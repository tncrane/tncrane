I have been working on coding and data analytics for over a year now, having completed a few Google certifications and the capstone projects associated with them. So far, I have learned the basics of SQL, and R, while becoming considerably more proficient with Microsoft Excel (and Google Sheets) and Python. With Python, I have been able to go as far as to build multiple machine learning models that make future predictions based on large amounts of data. The intersection of coding and data analytics is going to be my primary focus here on Github, as I intend to enter the industry, continue to learn, and complete some exciting future projects. 

Check out my projects as they are uploaded and feel free to offer feedback. I will definitely make mistakes, and I can definitely take criticism. Have a great day!

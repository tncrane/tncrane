-->How's it going? 

I am relatively new to coding and data analytics, having done a few Google certifications and the capstone projects associated with them. So far, I have learned the basics of SQL, R, and Python. With Python, I have been able to go as far as to build multiple machine 
learning models, such as an XG Boost model and Random Forests. The intersection of coding and data analytics is going to be my primary focus here on Github, as I intend to enter the industry, continue to learn, and complete some exciting future projects. 

Check out my projects as they are uploaded and feel free to offer feedback. I will definitely make mistakes, and I can definitely take criticism. Have a great day!
